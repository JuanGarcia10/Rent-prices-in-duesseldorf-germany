# Introduction

The following is an analysis of the rent prices in Germany, specially for the capital of Nordrhein-Westfalen (Düsseldorf)

I aim to answer three question:
1. How expensive is to live in Düsseldorf compare to any other city in Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW)?
2. How is the distribution of rent prices in the city? if we look for a specific borough/neighborhood and a given size?
3. How do the characteristics of a flat explain the variability in prize?

**Bonus question:**
4. Can the rent prices in Düsseldorf be accurately predicted using a linear model?

***A summary of my findings*** can be found in my blogpost in Medium - please follow this link

# About the Notebooks

For this project I used three different Notebooks to keep things better organized:
* "Data_cleaning_rent_flats_germany" compress all the data wrangling efforts - data gathering, assessment and cleaning
* "Data_exploration_flats_germany" compress all exploration efforts - understanding the data better and getting ideas for a proper model
* "Graphics_for_article" contains all the "polished" graphics answering the 3 main questions and a linear model that works pretty well predicting the rent of a flat

# About the Dataset

I am working with the dataset "immo_data.csv" from kaggle. This dataset contains information about the apartment (flats) rental offers in Germany. It was created by "CorrieBar" from the popular German website Immoscout24. It contains all published offers from 3 different days during 2018 and 2019. ***Please refer to Kaggle to get the data, as I did not include it in the repository***.

# Methodology

I use Python 3* for the analysis. No further requirements.
